## Checking the tamper-evident bag:

Upon receiving your ColdCard, ensure that the tamper-evident bag has not been compromised. If anything seems amiss or if you have any problems contact [support@coinkite.com.](mailto:support@coinkite.com?subject=%5BContact%5D%20-%20) Visually inspect the surfaces and edges of the bag for indications of tampering, openings, or damage.
